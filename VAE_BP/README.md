This directory contains most of the codes and data for recreating project from my Bachelor's Thesis on Variational Autoencoder and its extensions.

To start experimenting, download this repository and start your project with

```
using DrWatson
@quickactivate("VAE_BP")
```

Then you can run any experiment you wish, as they should be ready to launch.
