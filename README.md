# Welcome and welcome again!
This is a personal repository for data, codes and other files to carry out experiments related to my bachelor's thesis on Variational Autoencoder and its Extensions.

Feel welcome to look around :)

## Basic information
Variours project folders support `DrWatson` package for easier manipulation. You can clone the repository and use any of the codes as everything should be in place and working. Some minor manipulation with codes might be neccesarry.

Folders kdd_vae and pulsars are used for anomaly detection on KDD CUP 1999 and HTRU2 datasets. Currently used models are VAE and WAE. Other folders are used for different models and easy experiments with artificially generated data.

Folder MixtureVAE might spark interest as a new proposition for modelling mixture of variational autoencoder using EM algorithm. Various experiments are carried out on artifical data showing the power of this approach.
